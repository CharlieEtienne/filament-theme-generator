# Filament Theme Generator

## I'll try to build a Filament theme generator with Laravel

## Steps

- [x] Fresh Laravel app
- [x] Install Filament
- [x] Homepage skeleton
- [x] Add some fields
  - [x] 2 palettes: background and accent
- [x] Let users preview the theme
- [x] Let users copy the theme (css or php)
- [x] Add syntax highlighting to the code preview
- [ ] Add color picker to let users customize the theme

## Maybe Later

- [ ] Create a theme gallery with
  - [ ] Popular themes
  - [ ] Latest themes
  - [ ] Like button feature
